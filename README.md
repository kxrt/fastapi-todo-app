# Todo Application

I created this application to quickly get up to date with Python's FastAPI framework. The filestructure is as follows:

```
fastapi-todo-app
  - frontend
  - backend
```

## Backend

Setup:

```
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the backend application. It must be done before starting the frontend.

## Frontend

Setup:

```
cd frontend
yarn
yarn start
```

This will allow you to access the frontend through a webpage.
